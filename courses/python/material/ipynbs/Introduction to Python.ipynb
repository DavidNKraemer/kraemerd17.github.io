The Bisection Method provides us with a procedure for finding such a $c$. Here's how it works:\n",

    "Here's just a brief overview of the more advanced things you can do in `Python`. We won't use them in class, but it's good to know about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes\n",
    "`Python` can be object-oriented like `Java`. You declare classes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class My_Class:\n",
    "    self.field_one\n",
    "    self.field_two\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(args): # Equivalent to constructors in Java\n",
    "        # Initialization routine\n",
    "        # Every class needs one\n",
    "       \n",
    "    def method_one(args):\n",
    "        [do stuff]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming favors modularity, bringing wonderful returns to scale. In `Python`, class fields and methods must always be specified with the `self` keyword, similar to `this` in `Java`. Unlike in `Java`, this is not optional in `Python`. Method overriding is also not supported in `Python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lambda functions\n",
    "`Python` can be functional like `Scheme`. A lambda function uses the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "   lambda x: x**2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of including a predefined function in `bisection_method`, you could use a lambda function. Lambdas and other household names for the functional programmer are built in, such as:\n",
    "* `map`\n",
    "* `filter`\n",
    "* `reduce`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you like Scheme, you can make `Python` as functional as you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comprehensions\n",
    "In `Python` one important and useful tool is called list (or other Iterable) _comprehensions_. They allow you to construct lists from following rules, without the amount of code overhead that you might see in `C` or `Java`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example. Suppose you want to construct a list of all nonnegative even integers less than 20. The naive approach is to use some sort of loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "evens = []\n",
    "for i in range(20):\n",
    "    if i % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        evens.append(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensions allow you to take this routine and make it more concise. Instead, you can write\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "evens = [i for i in range(20) if i % 2 == 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you who are comfortable with simple set theory, this is equivalent to saying\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\textrm{Evens} = \\{ i \\in \\mathbb{N} : i < 20, i\\equiv 0 \\bmod{2} \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensions are a great way to make your code readable and concise. They cost a bit more (in terms of microseconds), but often the philosophy of `Python` is that readable code is preferable to slightly-faster ugly code.\n"
