    "a_{1,1}x_1 + a_{1,2}x_2 + \\cdots + a_{1,n}x_n &= b_1 \\\\\n",

    "you might be familiar with Gaussian elimination, which provides a systematic way to find a solution, if one exists. Now, we can compactly write this system of equations as a _matrix-vector_ equation $A\\vec{x}=\\vec{b}$, where $$(A_{i,j})=a_{i,j},$$ \n",
    "$$\\vec{x}=(x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n)^T,$$\n",
    "and $$\\vec{b}=(b_1, b_2, \\cdots, b_n)^T.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems with Gaussian Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian elimination has some significant advantages. First off, it will always find a solution, if one exists, in a finite number of steps. This is a powerful property, but it comes at a cost. For an $n\\times n$ matrix $A$, Gaussian elimination is an $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ algorithm, which means that the number of steps required to solve the system is proportional to the **cube** of the number of rows or columns of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't so bad for an $2\\times 2$ matrix, but it is downright impossible for an $10000\\times 10000$ one. So, we need to find a better approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory for Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "One alternative is the _method of gradient descent_. Consider a function $$f(\\vec{x})=\\frac{1}{2}\\vec{x}^T A \\vec{x} - \\vec{b}^T\\vec{x} + c,$$ where $A$ is a symmetric matrix, and $c$ is a scalar constant. Now, this implies that $f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$, which means that $f$ is a scalar function of $n$ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, $f$ is a _quadratic_ function, and it has a minimum. One can show that gradient of $f$ is given by $$ \\nabla f(\\vec{x}) = A\\vec{x} - \\vec{b}$$ for symmetric matrices $A$. This means that by finding an $\\vec{x}$ that satisfies $\\nabla f(\\vec{x})=0$ will simultaneously solve the system of equations $A\\vec{x}=\\vec{b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can visualize $f$ as a quadratic bowl, and the method of gradient descent looks for the minimum of the bowl.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/screenshots/6559/original.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Iterations of Gradient Descent\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above image, we have the paraboloid formed by $f$, as well as the iterations of solutions given by the gradient descent algorithm. Alternatively, you can think about the contours of $f$, and for this you can think of gradient descent as updating the locations of the guesses in the following image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://trond.hjorteland.com/thesis/img200.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Iterations of Gradient Descent on the Contours of f(x)\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the gradient of a function points in the direction of greatest-initial increase of the function. Perhaps mysteriously, the _antigradient_, $-\\nabla f$ points in the direction of greatest-initial _decrease_ of $f$. So, to minimize $f(\\vec{x})$, we can follow $-\\nabla f$ all the way down until we reach the bottom of the bowl.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note:\n",
    "From here on out, $\\vec{x}$ and $\\vec{b}$ will _always_ denote vectors, so we will not include the $\\vec{\\cdot}$ notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $x$ is the solution to the equation $Ax=b$. Imagine that you're given a _guess_ solution $x_{(i)}$. Then the _residual_ between the ideal solution and the guess is given by $$r_{(i)} = b - Ax_{(i)}.$$ Coincidentally, $r_{(i)}=-\\nabla f(x_{(i)})$, which means that when we update to $x_{(i+1)}$ we want to move in the direction of $r_{(i})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we update to $x_{(i+1)}$, we will update according to the rule $$x_{(i+1)} = x_{(i)} + \\alpha r_{(i)},$$ where $\\alpha$ is some number.\n",
    "\n",
    "What should $\\alpha$ be? We want to choose $\\alpha$ that makes the biggest improvement in one single step. It turns out that after doing some calculations, this $\\alpha$ is given by $$ \\alpha = \\frac{r_{(i)}^T r_{(i)}}{r_{(i)}^T A r_{(i)}}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Descent Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are given a matrix $A$ that is square and symmetric, along with a vector $b$. Here is how Gradient Descent works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set $i=0$.\n",
    "2. Initialize $x_0$.\n",
    "3. Set $r_i = b - Ax_i$.\n",
    "4. Let $\\alpha = \\dfrac{r_i^Tr_i}{r_i^TAr_i}$\n",
    "5. Set $x_{i+1} = x_i + \\alpha r_i$.\n",
    "6. Increment $i$.\n",
    "7. Go back to step (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminating the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "When $f(x_{(i)})$ is very close to the minimum, the vector $x_{(i)}$ is very close to the solution $x$. So, the residual vector $r_{(i)}$ is very close to the zero vector. In other words, the _magnitude_ of $r_{(i)}$ is approximately 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this to build a terminating condition. Since the magnitude of $r_{(i)}$ is given by $$\\|r_{(i)}\\| = r_{(i)}^Tr_{(i)},$$ we can tell our algorithm to stop as soon as $\\|r_{(i)}\\|$ is below some error tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Try It!\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to build and test an algorithm that applies the gradient descent method. Use the Gradient Descent Pseudocode to build a gradient descent algorithm. Remember, this function will take a symmetric matrix and a vector as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Try testing your algorithm with the matrices:\n",
    "$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 6 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$ and $b = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ -8\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "Your algorithm should produce:\n",
    "$x = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
