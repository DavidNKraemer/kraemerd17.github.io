    "From _Python for Data Analysis_:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The `IPython` project began in 2001 as Fernando Perez's side project to make a better interactive `Python` interpreter. In the subsequent 11 years it has grown into what's widely considered one of the most important tools in the modern scientific `Python` computing stack. While it does not provide any computational or data analytical tools by itself, `IPython` is designed from the ground up to maximize your productivity in both interactive computing and software development. It encourages an _execute-explore_ workflow instead of the typical _edit-compile-run_ workflow of many other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `IPython Notebook` uses an input-output programming paradigm centered around the _cell_. Excecuting a cell saves all of the data into the notebook, so you can use it later. But, you can execute a cell, write more code, and come back to the same cell to make changes, which gives the notebook an incredible amount of versatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each notebook uses an execution kernel to keep track of all of the data. If you run into a challenge, say, an accidental infinite loop, you can interrupt and restart the kernel from the options. Restarting the kernel drops all of the data saved to the main memory stack, so you need to re-execute all of your cells."

The `IPython Notebook` is (lovingly, but jokingly) referred to as the \"poor person's _Mathematica_\", which is unfair to both `IPython` and _Mathematica_. The Notebook serves a different purpose from Wolfram's product, and it does so exceptionally well."

    "\n",
    "> Writing code in a way that makes it easy to develop, debug, and ultimately _use_ interactively may be a paradigm shift for many users. There are procedural details like code reloading that may require some adjustment as well as coding style concerns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> As such, most of this section is more of an art than a science and will require some experimentation on your part to determine a way to write your `Python` code that is effective and productive for you. Ultimately you want to structure your code in a way that makes it easy to use iteratively and to be able to explore the results of running a program or function as effortlessly as possible.\n",

    "On these lines, here are some of McKinney's tips for good code design in `Python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flat is better than nested\n",
    "* Deeply nested code makes me think about the many layers of an onion.\n",
    "* When testing or debugging a function, how many layers of the onion must you peel back in order to reach the code of interest?\n",
    "* Making functions and classes as decoupled and modular aas possible makes them easier to test (if you are writing unit tests), debug, and use interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overcome a fear of longer files\n",
    "* If you come from a `Java` background, you may have been told to keep files short.\n",
    "* However, while developing code using `IPython`, working with 10 small, but interconnected files (under, say, 100 lines each) is likely to cause you more headache in general than a single large file or two or three longer files.\n",
    "* Fewer files means fewer modules to reload and less jumping between files while editing, too."

    "One fundamental problem in computing is array (or list) sorting. There are many different ways to sort, each providing distinct advantages. As a general rule, the best objective way to compare sorting algorithms is their efficiency, but this can change depending on the size of the array (or list) under consideration.\n",
