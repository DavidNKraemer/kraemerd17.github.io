## Course description

Python is a general-purpose programming language with a wonderful
community of open-source support, allowing it to solve a whole host of
problems from application development to data analysis. No prior
knowledge of Python is required for this course. This course will follow
“Python for Data Analysis” by Wes McKinney, which gives a great overview
of the tools that Python provides for sophisticated modeling, analysis,
and visualization. This course will introduce you to the IPython
environment, a powerful and robust tool for general scripting purposes.
It will also cover important aspects of Python's numerical computation
and data analysis libraries and will use several case studies to
illustrate important concepts.

## Why use Python?

Python has a number of qualities making it more attractive than its
competitors. First, Python is free. It only takes an idea and some
perseverance to do sophisticated data analysis, not a hefty subscription
to proprietary software. Second, Python is user-friendly. Python's code
is clear, concise, and powerful; it doesn't take a degree in computer
science to learn it! Finally, Python is professional. For researchers,
analysts, hobbyists, and anyone in between, Python provides a host of
tools that allow you to acquire, clean, analyze, and visualize data fit
for publication or presentation.

## What will I gain from this class?

By taking this class you can expect to gain proficiency in Python's
NumPy and Pandas libraries, as well as the ability to use Matplotlib for
data visualization. The IPython notebook is the primary development
environment that this class will use, so you will learn how to use the
tools it provides to improve their efficiency as programmers. Data
analysis is emerging as the lingua franca of diverse professions ranging
from scientific research to business enterprise, and Python is a
powerful but programmer-friendly alternative to closed-source programs
like MATLAB and Excel.

## Will this class teach me Python basics?

We want this ExCo to focus on the scientific computation and data
analysis libraries built in Python, so we will not spend much time
covering Python syntax and language features. However, there are a
plethora of good resources online to pick up a "conversational" level of
Python in order to make sense of the material that we cover. Above, we
have listed a selection of sites that we have personally found useful.
For those of you interested in a brief overview of syntax, check out
[CodeAcademy's Python
Tutorial](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). Here you can get
a good working knowledge of the core Python we will rely on for the
class. The entire tutorial is estimated at 13 hours, but for the
material we cover, you probably can do the first 5 hours of it to be
comfortable.

If you know basic Python syntax and want to see it in action on a small
scale, you should check out [CodingBat's Python
exercises.](http://www.codingbat.com/python) They provide simple, but
thought-provoking problems that force you to test your knowledge of
Python syntax in order to solve them. If you're an experienced computer
scientist or have dealt with Python before, advanced problems can be
found at [CodeWars' Python problems.](http://www.codewars.com) These
questions range from trivial to exceptionally difficult, and often will
require you to consider not only solving the problem at hand, but doing
so efficiently.

## Data analysis libraries and resources

This class will explore the core data analysis libraries in Python:

-   NumPy: fast, vectorized array computation. This is the bread and
    butter of all advanced data analysis programming.
-   pandas: a software library useful for large-scale analysis and
    Excel-like computation.
-   matplotlib: robust graphical visualization, compatible with NumPy
    and pandas.

These libraries are extensive, and we can't possibly go through them
all. Instead, we'll show you simple applications of these tools to get
you acquainted with them. Consulting the documentation for each of the
respective libraries is the best way to learn more about them, but
documentation is difficult to read, so this class will also help you get
used to extracting the important information from the documentation.

We will be using *Python for Data Analysis* by Wes McKinney to build
lesson plans on the topics covered in this class. The book can be found
[on Amazon,
here](http://www.amazon.com/%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425167167&sr=8-1&keywords=%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20python+for+data+analysis),
but unless you fall in love with Python and want to have it as a
reference, we don't recommend that you purchase it. This is because
there are a multitude of great, free resources available online. We will
probably borrow shamelessly from a number of online sources as well as
the text, and we will do our best to site them (if you spot an
oversight, please tell us!).

While NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib form the core data analysis tools in
Python, there are other libraries we will not cover. That does not mean
you should not check them out! Here are a few notable projects:

-   [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/): easy
    web scraping tools
-   [SciPy](scipy.org): the parent project of NumPy; contains a huge
    repository of useful scientific functions
-   [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html): symbolic algebra
    computation in Python (i.e. open-source Mathematica)
-   [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/): extensive
    statistics and machine learning libraries
-   [seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/): beautiful
    statistical plotting
-   [prettyplotlib](https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib): aesthetic
    wrapper for matplotlib
-   [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/): fantastic database of free (and
    premium) economic and financial data
