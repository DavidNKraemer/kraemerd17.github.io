# Introduction to Professional Typesetting with \\(\LaTeX\\)

**David Kraemer and Caleb Leedy**

### Course description

This is an introductory course in learning how to create professional
documents using the language \\(\LaTeX\\) . This course will focus on
professional typesetting techniques with a special emphasis on
mathematical typesetting. By the end of the course students should feel
confident writing a paper for any subject (including a mathematical
proof or math homework) in \\(\LaTeX\\) as well as a resume and, time
permitting, presentation typesetting.

### Why use \\(\LaTeX\\)?

Have you ever had to type and equation for class on Microsoft Word? If
so, you know the unyielding frustration of selecting the right fields
and symbols, filling them correctly, and checking for all of the amazing
ways it can screw up. Have you ever wished that typesetting

\\[ 
\int\_{\partial \Sigma} Pdx+Qdy = 
\iint\_{\Sigma} \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} -
\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)dA
\\]
 
could be achieved quickly, correctly, and beautifully?

\\(\LaTeX\\) is the solution to your problems, and it does much more too.
In fact, nearly all professional papers, journal articles, conference
presentations, research posters, dissertations, textbooks, and much more
are written using \\(\LaTeX\\). Its advantages over Word are numerous, so
you should learn how to use it now, and save yourself endless
frustration!

### Why will I gain from this class?

You will gain the ability to typeset your math homework as well as
create a resume for your employers. If you are taking or will be taking
math courses at Grinnell College, you will have the experience necessary
to understand easily how to type your math homework, which eventually
becomes an essential asset. Above all, \\(\LaTeX\\) is the typesetting
standard for all research documents, whether in academia or in industry.
If you are considering this career path, an operating knowledge of
\\(\LaTeX\\) is a must.
