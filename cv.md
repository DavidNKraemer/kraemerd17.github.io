## Work Experience

### Undergraduate Researcher (MAP) at Grinnell College

_May 2015 - Aug 2015_.

I investigated polychromatic analogues to fundamental theorems in Ramsey Theory. My team successfully conjectured and proved an analogous Rado's Theorem for \\(r\\)-bounded colorings of \\(\mathbb{N}\\). We also developed \\(r\\)-bounded coloring algorithms that strove to minimize frequency of polychromatic solutions. We also spent some time scripting with Python to perform numerical simulations.



### Undergraduate Researcher (REU) at the University of Chicago

_June 2014 - August 2014_.

I developed and tested software in Python for computed tomographic (CT) imaging, built upon established mathematical models
to improve reconstruction, presented findings in weekly program meetings, compiled research into two conference submissions, and contributed to
a journal submission.
