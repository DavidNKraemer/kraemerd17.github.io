Makes two regular-sized loaves.

# Ingredients

## Dough

#### Slurry

* Water (1 1/4 cups)
* Active dry yeast (2 1/4 tsps)
* Honey (1 tbsp)

#### Main dough

* Olive oil (3/4 cups)
* Honey (3/4 cups)
* Table salt (2 tsps)
* Large eggs (4)
* Bread flour (5+ cups)

#### Spices

* Ground cloves (two pinches)
* Cinnamon (1/2 tsp)
* Nutmeg (1/4 tsp)

## Glaze

* Large egg (1)
* Vanilla extract (a dash)
* Cinnamon (1/8 tsp)

# Directions

In a small bowl, heat the **water** in the microwave for 45 seconds on high, so
that after submrging your finger in it for about 10 seconds it is "uncomfortably
hot." Add **1 tbsp honey** to the water, and stir well until the honey is mostly
dissolved. Add the **active dry yeast**, gently stirring the yeast into the
water. It's okay if the result is somewhat uneven. Let this sit for at least 20
minutes.

In a medium sized bowl, combine the **oil**, **honey**, **salt**, **spices**,
and **eggs**, and mix lightly, so that all the yolks are broken up and the
mixture appears fairly uniform in color and texture. Add the now-frothy
**slurry**, and stir. The resulting mixture will likely not be uniform, which is
not a problem.

Gradually (for example, one cup at a time), add **flour** into the bowl with a
wooden spoon, making sure to mix well after each addition. When the mixture
begins to form into a ball, knead the dough until it isn't sticky to the touch.
If you poke the dough, it should regain its original shape. You can add flour as
necessary, but err on the side of being too sticky than too tough. If you are
making the dough on the same day as baking, let the dough sit out for at least
three hours before proceeding. If you plan to refrigerate the dough for a later
date, you should take out the dough at least three hours before beginning to
work on the braiding.

Since the batch makes two loaves, separate the dough and braid. I have found
that it is most effective to roll out the strands of the challah in small
amounts at a time with about 15 minutes in between each step. This allows the
dough to rise as much as possible. After the strands have been rolled out (I
like them about 12 inches long), let them rise for another 15 minutes before
braiding. If you want to stuff the strands, now is the best time. Braid the
dough and let the loaves sit for another 15-30 minutes. At this point preheat
the oven to 350° or (325° for a standard convection oven).

To prepare the glaze, mix the **large egg** together with the **vanilla
extract** and **cinnamon** in a small bowl. The yolk helps to give the challah a
brown color, so it's up to you if you want to use the yolk. Apply the glaze to
the loaves, and bake the loaves for 30-35 minutes (or 25 minutes for a
convection oven). Afterwards, transfer the loaves to a cooling rack and let them
sit for at least a half-hour before serving.
