# Sweet

## Fruits

* **Raisins**. I prefer golden raisins to regular raisins. Before stuffing, soak
  the raisins in a small bowl of warm water. This "rehydrates" the raisins,
which moistens the final product. It also removes some of the preservatives that
are used in packaging. _V+_
* **Apples**.  Peel **two apples** and dice them. (I recommend **granny smith
  apples**). In a glass baking dish, combine the apples with **1/8 cup maple
syrup**, **1 tbsp coconut oil**, **1/4 tsps ground cinnamon**, **1/8 tsps ground
ginger**, **a pinch of cloves**, and **1/8 tsps salt**. Preheat the oven to
350Â°, and over medium heat on the stove bring the liquid of the dish to a boil.
Stir the apples until the liquid becomes sticky and thick, which should be very
fast. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes. Take the dish
out, stir the apples around, and let bake for another 15 minutes. Take out the
apples, and let them cool for a half hour before stuffing into the challah.
*Disclaimer*: this preparation takes about 60 minutes. _V+_
* **Blueberries**. Blueberries are a great tangy contrast to other sweet
  ingredients, and they can be quite wonderful during the spring and summer
months. Just make sure to rinse them before stuffing. _V+_

## Chocolates

* **Chocolate chips**. Dairy chocolate melts better in the oven with the challah
  than parev (and vegan) chocolate seems to do. If you want the chocolate chips to
be parev (and vegan), you might try lightly heating the chocolate chips before
stuffing. _DAIRY_ (but possibly _V+_)
* **Oreos**. Take 5-8 (regular, and *definitely not double-stuffed*) Oreos and
  smash them with a spoon until they are just pieces of cookie, and stuff them
into the strands. _V+, DAIRY_

# Savory

* Green onion
